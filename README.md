# GeoResource Collection
 A collection of data or tools that I find useful in my learning of earth science ;) 
# open access data
## 1. climatic data 
### 1.1 weather station records
- [Climate Data Online NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) \
An online portal that contains the collection of meteorological data from global weather stations.
- [SMHI](https://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/)
Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute provides detailed long-term monitoring data.
- [Tarfala Research Station](https://su.figshare.com/TRS)
Meteorological record of weather station at Tarfala Research Station, Stockholm University. Mass balance record of Storglaciären can be found at [Bolin Center for Climate Research](https://bolin.su.se/data/tarfala/tarfalaglaciaren.php).
### 1.2 Assimulated Global Climatic data
- [GLDAS NOAH](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?page=1&project=GLDAS)
Global Land Data Assimilation System ingests satellite and ground-based observational data products (0.25 arc degree) \
The data can be downloaded mannually or automatically by a [tool](https://github.com/fsn1995/PythonFSN/blob/master/EarthdataDownload.py). Google Earth Engine also has access to the data. I have done a [practice](https://github.com/fsn1995/Fun-with-Google-Earth-Engine/blob/master/Noah.js) to convert the units and display the global monthly/annual precipitation and temperature. 
- [SST](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/REYNOLDS_NCDC_L4_SST_HIST_RECON_MONTHLY_V3B_NETCDF)
Smith and Reynolds NCDC Level 4 Historical Reconstructed SST Monthly Data. 
### 1.3 Other
- [Hurrican path](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=ib-v4-access)
International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) gives us hurrican tracks in csv/netcdf/shapefile formats. 
- and more...
## 2. useful tools/software
### 2.1 Google Earth Engine source: 
- [earthengine-py-notebooks](https://github.com/giswqs/earthengine-py-notebooks)
- [gee-community](https://github.com/gee-community)
- [fun with gee](https://github.com/fsn1995/Fun-with-Google-Earth-Engine) Note this is my own practice templates so you may ignore and skip it :)
### 2.2 R library
- [SPEI](https://github.com/sbegueria/SPEIbase)
Standard Precipitation and Evaportranspiration Index. https://spei.csic.es/ An useful and reliable drought index.
### 2.3 Matlab
- [Efficient subpixel image registration by cross-correlation](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/18401/versions/4/previews/html/efficient_subpixel_registration.html)
A powerful  tool to achieve high precision sub-pixel image registration. :+1:
- [ImGRAFT](https://github.com/grinsted/ImGRAFT)
An Image Georectification and Feature Tracking toolbox. This is where I started the glacier surge project. Personally I learned a lot from it. :mountain_snow:
### 2.4 ENVI/IDL
- [COSI-CORR](http://www.tectonics.caltech.edu/slip_history/spot_coseis/download_software.html)
Tools for displacement tracking.
### 2.5 Other
- [Awesome GIS](https://github.com/sshuair/awesome-gis)
The most comprehensive GIS library.
- [Geofolio](https://geofolio.org/#select-area)
Quick tool to check the climate, landcover and other land surface conditions at your study area. 

#### Hope this will make our life easier. Feel free to share your collection of data and comment.
